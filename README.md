# CoRefine-TM
CoRefine-TM is a neural topic modeling framework designed to enhance topic coherence and interpretability in semantically rich and morphologically complex languages like Arabic. The model integrates contextual embeddings with a variational autoencoder (VAE), incorporating negative sampling with triplet loss to improve the separation of latent topics. A post-hoc Grouping–Scoring–Modeling (GSM) pipeline further refines and categorizes the generated topics, enabling scalable and interpretable topic exploration. CoRefine-TM is particularly effective on religious and classical Arabic texts, such as Hadith corpora.
